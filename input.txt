FORMAT:
	Name HoursRequired Month Day
	
	Month must use first three letters, capitalize the first
	Day must use two digits
	End it in a period on the next line

RULES:
	Names can be repeated, but they are displayed with their name so tough luck figuring out which is which

HOW:
	Uses a ratio of DaysTillDue : Hours Required
	
LIMITATIONS:
	Any assignment with 0 hours required may crash system (x/0)

	Accounts for leap years, but not if the assignment is due next year
		Uses the current year's leap year status, for example if the current year is not leap but next year is, will only count feb as 28th for both

	Any assignment due today will be unsorted grouped together, (0/x), so use your discretion
		(Don't use discretion, because then this entire thing is pointless)
